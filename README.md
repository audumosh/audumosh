### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Moshood Audu, a medical doctor and healthcare strategist from Nigeria. I am dedicated to transforming health systems through innovative and evidence-based cross-sectoral approaches. Passionate about devising dynamic solutions that bolster healthcare infrastructure, expand access, and ensure affordability for marginalized communities.
 
Before enrolling in the MSc International Health and Tropical Medicine, I worked as a Public Health Advisor at Palladium Group. I also worked as a Health Management Consultant at Sydani Group and as a consultant for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In these roles, I led numerous teams in advising the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health, the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, and the National Center for Disease Control to improve health system research, financing, information systems, and commodities supply chain management. My primary focus has been on utilizing high-quality research to enhance health financing and delivery of primary healthcare services in Africa.
I am proficient in stakeholder management and have developed key partnerships with government institutions at national and sub-national levels, private sector entities, and international donors like Gavi, BMGF, UNICEF, WHO, and USAID.
